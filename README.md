# LLM Basics

This is a simple example showing how to use OpenAI API to communicate with LLM Factory Endpoints

# Usage

First, retrieve your API key from LLM Factory https://data.ai.uky.edu/llm-factory/user/getAPIKey

Next, copy config.ini.example into config.ini and place your API Key in the openai_api_key field

Finally, try the three example scripts. 
* chat_completions_test.py is used to chat with the model
* embeddings_test.py is used to create vector embeddings from text
* transcriptions_test.py is used to generate a transcription from a short audio file
